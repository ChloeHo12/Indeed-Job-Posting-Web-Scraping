# Web Scraping Indeed.com - Extracting Job Posting Data

## 1. Objective
The objective of this project is to scrape job postings from Indeed.com, collect the data and perform data analysis to extract insights about the job market. The project aims to identify the companies that are hiring the most for the given job titles and locations, determine the distribution of job titles and their average salaries and analyze the frequency of certain keywords in job descriptions, and determine which skills and qualifications are most in demand.

## 2. Process
The following steps were followed in the project:
- Choose a location and a set of keywords that are relevant to a specific field of study.
- Scrape job postings from Indeed.com using selenium and python. The code should extract the following information for each job posting:
    - Job title
    - Company name
    - Job description
    - Job location
    - Date posted
- Clean and preprocess the data as necessary.
- Use data analysis techniques to extract insights about the job market. For example:
    - Identify which companies are hiring the most for the given job titles and locations.
    - Determine the distribution of job titles and their average salaries.
    - Analyze the frequency of certain keywords in job descriptions, and determine which skills and qualifications are most in demand.
- Write a report summarizing the findings.

## 3. Usage
To run the code, you need to have the following installed on your machine:
- Python 3
- Selenium
- Pandas


## 4. Report
The report summarizing the findings can be found in the report.ipynb file in the root directory of the project.
